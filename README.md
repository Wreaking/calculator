# Simple Calculator

Welcome to the **Simple Calculator** project! This interactive tool is designed to perform a variety of mathematical operations, including arithmetic, comparison, and trigonometric calculations.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, divide, and more!
- **Comparison Operations**: Compare two numbers with various operators.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Calculate sine, cosine, tangent, and hyperbolic functions.

## Algorithm

1. Start

3. Display Welcome Message
- Print a welcome message with options for operations.

3. Prompt for Arithmetic Operations
- Ask the user if they want to perform arithmetic operations (Y/N).

4. If User Chooses Arithmetic (Y)
Prompt for the type of arithmetic operator (e.g., +, -, *, /, %, **).
Prompt for result type (Integer/Float).
Input two numbers (num1` and `num2').

5. Perform Selected Arithmetic Operation
- If Addition: Calculate result and display in a table.
- If Subtraction: Calculate result and display in a table.
- If Multiplication: Calculate result and display in a table.
- If Division:
- Check for division by zero. If valid, calculate and display result.
- If Modulus: Calculate result and display in a table.
- If Exponentiation: Calculate result and display in a table.
- If Floor Division: Calculate result and display in a table.
- Else: Print invalid operator message.
- 
6. If User Chooses Comparison (N)
Prompt for comparison operations (Y/N).
- If user chooses (Y):
Input two numbers (num1` and `num2`).
Prompt for comparison operator (e.g., ==, >, <).
Evaluate and display result in a table.

7. If User Chooses Trigonometry (N
Prompt for trigonometric operations (Y/N).
If user chooses (Y):
- Input angle in degrees (num1').
Convert angle to radians.
Prompt for trigonometric operator (e.g., Sin, Cos, Tan).
Calculate and display result in a table.

8. If User Chooses No Operations
Display a message asking why they are using the calculator.
